# People, capability & collaboration

## Team capability

Typical health data science projects require a multidisciplinary team. The involvement of different roles will likely fluctuate through the different stages of a project lifecycle.

Commonly needed skills include the areas below. Some individuals will have multiple skills, but few will have everything they need.

* subject matter expertise in data
* machine learning
* design
* clinical
* governance
* consumer/patient and specifically impacted communities
* legal and privacy
* ethics
* implementation and change management

Often you may be involved in multiple projects, and you may find it useful to share expertise across projects.

It is particularly important to ensure plenty of time for clinical input to data understanding and preparation for data science. Defining input features in clinically relevant ways is really important for health data science. For example, 'cancer' might be an important input at an individual level - does this mean currently active cancer? Within the last five years? Any exclusions? Time needs to be allocated to work through and validate these definitions with clinicians.

* Refer to **End-user engagement** below (-@sec-end-user-engagement).

* Advisory groups are a good way to elicit feedback. Early in any project try to meet with a group of experts and discuss your research plan. Experts will always understand aspects of the research which need to be considered beyond what is in the data.

## End-user engagement {#sec-end-user-engagement}

End users (usually consumers and clinicians) should be engaged early for co-design, and to understand how outputs can be tangible for those who will use them or be impacted by them. Refer [Transparency, interpretability, and explanation](#clinician-in-the-loop). Understand workflows and where tools/models may be used. End-user engagement will also help to drive IT implementation if the benefits are clearly articulated to the appropriate stakeholders so work can be prioritised.

### Impacted customers/patients/groups

Any recommendations for changes or improvements should be interpreted through the lens of the groups they are likely to affect, acknowledging the principle of "nothing about us without us".

Data scientists are unlikely to have the correct context or cultural awareness to fully grasp what the data is telling them. This includes MƒÅori and other ethnicity groups, consumers, and perspectives that cover age and ability ranges.

### Clinicians

Clinical engagement will often make or break a project\'s success - both to ensure efficacy and to evangelise the results. In general, clinicians will adopt tools and models that fit into their workflow patterns, saving time or reducing errors.

Co-designing from the start and having a clinical champion/sponsor to ensure that developments can be incorporated in existing workflows so they can be used will set you up for success see [Operational deployment](#operational-deployment).

Interpretability **(understanding the reasoning behind predictions and decisions made by the model)** is also key. Important stakeholders are unlikely to have lots of time to learn about your work, so displaying it in an easy to understand manner is essential. It shouldn\'t be assumed that everyone will interpret the outputs in the same way, and understand what action is then required. Keep in mind that prospective customers may not be technologically or mathematically savvy.

## Collaboration

* Agree collaboration will be be supported across different organisations (who may all be using different software and systems and have limitations around what can be used).

* Role definition, responsibilities

* Regular check-ins/stand-ups are helpful

* Be mindful of individuals' schedules and availability, particularly clinicians

## Measuring success

* Be clear what success looks like. This will be different for research vs. implementation.

    * Are you looking to learn/measure something specific?

    * Are you expecting secondary or downstream benefits

* Making sure the bigger picture is kept in mind - not getting lost in the detail in a way that doesn't add value

* Have we reached the point of diminishing returns for investing further in model development?

* If you have measurable benefits as an objective, you should develop a benefits realisation plan

## Project management

* Data science is an iterative process of development as we progressively learn more about the data, relationships in the data and how effective modelling is.

* Good project management or product development practices should be applied to data science projects, while accepting that these projects are often experimental or exploratory in nature.

* Data issues flow 'downstream' and can impact every other part of a project. Ensure that sufficient time is allocated upfront to review and correct data quality (this also often happens in cycles - the analysis reveals quirks in the data that can be explored further and corrected).

* Project management should strive for continuous visibility, demonstrable progress. How are we tracking against timelines, budget, and the desired outcome?

* Create open feedback channels where possible

    * Think about how to develop mockups/prototypes as early as possible for feedback - can you start with a very simple model, Excel dashboard or static design to help ensure that what you are developing will deliver value?

* Healthcare data science projects will often span multiple organisations

* Documenting failures and lessons learnt helps prevent repeating mistakes.

* Technology for progress tracking: Consider

    * Jira,

    * a spreadsheet-based activity tracker,

    * Trello board,

    * emailed summaries of actions and next steps

## Governance

Good governance is fundamentally concerned with the value and risk of a project, and needs to be established to ensure accountability and oversight. Developing policies and procedures are a way of managing risk and clearly articulating principles of accountability, transparency, ethical use, privacy, and consent.

You should define and tailor a governance approach based on the needs of your own organisation.

Usually a data science project is undertaken within a wider programme of work, which has its own governance structure and processes. Occasionally, more substantial initiatives will require their own standalone governance.

Governance may be applied at different levels, such as governance of data (inputs) or governance of models (product/output). Those involved in model governance should come from diverse demographic and technical backgrounds, including perspectives of consumers and/or those who are impacted by the outputs of your work. Those involved in data governance need to have an understanding of data flows - how data is captured, stored and used.

Questions to ask:

* Are ethics applications required?

* What existing governance groups and/or processes would need to be involved?

* Which policies need to be followed?

* What level of documentation is required throughout?

* Will this be shared publicly? If so, how?

* Who is responsible for signing off?

* Is a new governance structure or process required here?

* What maintenance and/or ongoing review may be required? [NICE Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies](https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/evidence-standards-framework-for-digital-health-technologies) has a helpful list of points to consider
