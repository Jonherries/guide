## About this guide

This guide is a collection of learnings based on the experience of Aotearoa New Zealand health data science researchers and other contributors. Aimed at practitioners and those that oversee their work, the guide is intended to provide practical advice without repeating the content of publicly available resources and references; instead, links to these are provided. For data scientists, the guide also assumes a basic understanding of data science techniques, addressing the context and principles of how these are applied to lead to a successful outcome.

Earlier sections outline the context and setup of a health data science project; later sections introduce the technical aspects of data science including modelling.

Please contribute to this guide to share your knowledge and questions with the wider health data science research community. It is a living document and contributions from all viewpoints are most welcome. You can contribute directly by editing a page using the "Edit this page" link in the right sidebar, or by working with the page source directly. Pages are Markdown-formatted text files in a [public GitHub repository](https://precisiondrivenhealth.github.io/guide/) rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Alternatively, you can send suggestions through email to info at precisiondrivenhealth.com.
