# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This guide is an online resource of learnings based on the experience of Aotearoa New Zealand health data science researchers and other contributors. It is aimed at practitioners and those that oversee their work. The guide is intended to provide practical advice and clarifications without repeating the content of publicly available resources and references; instead, these are linked. In describing data sceince techniques, the guide assumes a basic technical understanding, addressing the context and principles of how these are applied to lead to a successful outcome.

We hope this will be a helpful resource for people and organisations who are starting out in data science, as well as experienced professionals who can share their lessons learned with the wider community in a helpful format.

## About this guide

The guide is structured roughly along a data science [project life cycle](basics.qmd#data-projects-have-a-lifecycle): earlier sections outline the context and setup of a health data science project; later sections introduce the technical aspects of data science including modelling.
