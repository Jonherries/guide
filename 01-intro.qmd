# Introduction

## About this guide

This guide is a collection of learnings based on the experience of New Zealand health data science researchers and other contributors. It is aimed at practitioners and those that oversee their work, providing practical advice without repeating publicly available resources and references (which are instead linked to). For data scientists, the guide also assumes a basic understanding of data science techniques, addressing the context and principles of how these are applied to lead to a successful outcome.

The guide is not intended to be a detailed technical reference on particular data science tool sets or clinical concepts.

Earlier sections outline the context and setup of a health data science project; later sections introduce the technical aspects of data science including modelling.
