	abstract = {Introduction Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) can diagnose skin cancers with impressive accuracy in experimental settings, however, their performance in the real-world clinical setting, including comparison to teledermatology services, has not been validated in prospective clinical studies. Methods and analysis Participants will be recruited from dermatology clinics at the Alfred Hospital and Skin Health Institute, Melbourne. Skin lesions will be imaged using a proprietary dermoscopic camera. The artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithm, a {CNN} developed by {MoleMap} Ltd and Monash {eResearch}, classifies lesions as benign, malignant or uncertain. This is a preintervention/postintervention study. In the preintervention period, treating doctors are blinded to {AI} lesion assessment. In the postintervention period, treating doctors review the {AI} lesion assessment in real time, and have the opportunity to then change their diagnosis and management. Any skin lesions of concern and at least two benign lesions will be selected for imaging. Each participant’s lesions will be examined by a registrar, the treating consultant dermatologist and later by a teledermatologist. At the conclusion of the preintervention period, the safety of the {AI} algorithm will be evaluated in a primary analysis by measuring its sensitivity, specificity and agreement with histopathology where available, or the treating consultant dermatologists’ classification. At trial completion, {AI} classifications will be compared with those of the teledermatologist, registrar, treating dermatologist and histopathology. The impact of the {AI} algorithm on diagnostic and management decisions will be evaluated by: (1) comparing the initial management decision of the registrar with their {AI}-assisted decision and (2) comparing the benign to malignant ratio (for lesions biopsied) between the preintervention and postintervention periods.

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies have shown promising performance of artificial intelligence ({AI}) algorithms for diagnosis of lesions in skin cancer. To date, none of these have assessed algorithm performance in the real-world setting. Objective: The aim of this project is to evaluate practical issues of implementing a convolutional neural network developed by {MoleMap} Ltd and Monash University {eResearch} in the clinical setting. Methods: Participants were recruited from the Alfred Hospital and Skin Health Institute, Melbourne, Australia, from November 1, 2019, to May 30, 2021. Any skin lesions of concern and at least two additional lesions were imaged using a proprietary dermoscopic camera. Images were uploaded directly to the study database by the research nurse via a custom interface installed on a clinic laptop. Doctors recorded their diagnosis and management plan for each lesion in real time. A pre-post study design was used. In the preintervention period, participating doctors were blinded to {AI} lesion assessment. An interim safety analysis for {AI} accuracy was then performed. In the postintervention period, the {AI} algorithm classified lesions as benign, malignant, or uncertain after the doctors’ initial assessment had been made. Doctors then had the opportunity to record an updated diagnosis and management plan. After discussing the {AI} diagnosis with the patient, a final management plan was agreed upon. Results: Participants at both sites were high risk (for example, having a history of melanoma or being transplant recipients). 743 lesions were imaged in 214 participants. In total, 28 dermatology trainees and 17 consultant dermatologists provided diagnoses and management decisions, and 3 experienced teledermatologists provided remote assessments. A dedicated research nurse was essential to oversee study processes, maintain study documents, and assist with clinical workflow. In cases where {AI} algorithm and consultant dermatologist diagnoses were discordant, participant anxiety was an important factor in the final agreed management plan to biopsy or not. Conclusions: Although {AI} algorithms are likely to be of most use in the primary care setting, higher event rates in specialist settings are important for the initial assessment of algorithm safety and accuracy. This study highlighted the importance of considering workflow issues and doctor-patient-{AI} interactions prior to larger-scale trials in community-based practices.

	abstract = {Background Mobile devices provide new opportunities for the prevention of overweight and obesity in children. We aimed to co-create and test an app that offered comprehensible feedback to parents on their child’s growth and delivered a suite of age-specific information about nutrition and activity. Methods A two-phased approach was used to co-create the digital growth tool—See How They Grow—and test its feasibility. Phase one used focus groups (parents and professionals such as paediatricians and midwives) and a national on-line survey to gather requirements and build the app. Phase two involved testing the app over 12-weeks, with parents or carers of children aged ≤ 2-years. All research activities were undertaken exclusively through the app, and participants were recruited using social media and hard copy materials given to patents at a child health visit. Findings Four focus groups and 101 responses to the national survey informed the features and functions to include in the final app. Two hundred and twenty-five participants downloaded the app, resulting in 208 eligible participants. Non-Māori/Non-Pacific (78\%) and Māori (14\%) had the highest downloads. Fifty-four per cent of participants were parents of children under 6-months. These participants were more likely to regularly use the app than those with children older than 6-months (64\% vs 36\%, P = 0.011). Over half of the participants entered three measures (n = 101, 48\%). Of those that completed the follow-up survey (n = 101, 48\%), 72 reported that the app helped them better understand how to interpret growth charts. Conclusion The app was acceptable and with minor modifications, has the potential to be an effective tool to support parents understanding of growth trajectories for their children. A larger trial is needed to evaluate if the app can have a measurable impact on increasing knowledge and behaviour, and therefore on preventing childhood overweight and obesity.},

	abstract = {With the advances in high-throughput biotechnologies, high-dimensional multi-layer omics data become increasingly available. They can provide both confirmatory and complementary information to disease risk and thus have offered unprecedented opportunities for risk prediction studies. However, the high-dimensionality and complex inter/intra-relationships among multi-omics data have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Here we present a computationally efficient penalized linear mixed model with generalized method of moments estimator ({MpLMMGMM}) for the prediction analysis on multi-omics data. Our method extends the widely used linear mixed model proposed for genomic risk predictions to model multi-omics data, where kernel functions are used to capture various types of predictive effects from different layers of omics data and penalty terms are introduced to reduce the impact of noise. Compared with existing penalized linear mixed models, the proposed method adopts the generalized method of moments estimator and it is much more computationally efficient. Through extensive simulation studies and the analysis of positron emission tomography imaging outcomes, we have demonstrated that {MpLMMGMM} can simultaneously consider a large number of variables and efficiently select those that are predictive from the corresponding omics layers. It can capture both linear and nonlinear predictive effects and achieves better prediction performance than competing methods.},

Given the complexity of healthcare decisions, it is likely that {ML} outputs will need to be understood and trusted by physicians, and then explained to patients. We therefore investigated the association between physician understanding of {ML} outputs, their ability to explain these to patients, and their willingness to trust the {ML} outputs, using various {ML} explainability methods.We designed a survey for physicians with a diagnostic dilemma that could be resolved by an {ML} risk calculator. Physicians were asked to rate their understanding, explainability, and trust in response to 3 different {ML} outputs. One {ML} output had no explanation of its logic (the control) and 2 {ML} outputs used different model-agnostic explainability methods. The relationships among understanding, explainability, and trust were assessed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests of association.The survey was sent to 1315 physicians, and 170 (13\%) provided completed surveys. There were significant associations between physician understanding and explainability (P \&lt; .001), between physician understanding and trust (P \&lt; .001), and between explainability and trust (P \&lt; .001). {ML} outputs that used model-agnostic explainability methods were preferred by 88\% of physicians when compared with the control condition; however, no particular {ML} explainability method had a greater influence on intended physician behavior.Physician understanding, explainability, and trust in {ML} risk calculators are related. Physicians preferred {ML} outputs accompanied by model-agnostic explanations but the explainability method did not alter intended physician behavior.},

Within countries also, there is variation. Even in jurisdictions with high overall rates of adoption, some providers are sophisticated ‘super-users’ of {EHRs}, whereas others use only their rudimentary functionalities.7–9 The adoption and full employment of an {EHR} reflects multiple factors, not the least of which are the financial and non-financial costs of procuring and implementing these platforms.10 Federal-level investment—including policy development, use of legislative levers, and support with resources or subsidies—undoubtedly affects the speed of adoption.11 However, even within a maximally supportive environment, there are those who remain ‘{EHR}-wary’, citing both uncertain benefit and risk of harm (particularly to clinicians). In this viewpoint, we argue that these {EHR} concerns may be overstated, irrelevant and/or mitigable, and should neither be used to justify delays in adoption nor full use.

There are currently no models specifically designed for the neurosurgical population. {OBJECTIVE} To develop and validate a neurosurgical risk prediction model, with 30-d, 1-yr, and 2-yr mortality endpoints. {METHODS} We accessed information on all adults in New Zealand who underwent neurosurgery or spinal surgery between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2016, from an administrative database. Our dataset comprised of 18 375 participants, split randomly into derivation (75\%) and validation (25\%) datasets. Previously established covariates tested included American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grade ({ASA}-{PS}), surgical acuity, operative severity, cancer status, and age. Exploratory covariates included anatomical site, gender, diabetes, trauma, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO}) regression analysis was used to construct 30-d, 1-yr, and 2-yr mortality models. {RESULTS} Our final models included 8 covariates: age, {ASA}-{PS} grade, surgical acuity, cancer status, anatomical site, diabetes, ethnicity, and trauma. The area under the receiver operating curve for the 30-d, 1-yr, and 2-yr mortality models was 0.90, 0.91, and 0.91 indicating excellent discrimination, respectively. Calibration also showed excellent performance with {McFadden}'s pseudo R2 statistics of 0.28, 0.37, and 0.41 and calibration plot slopes of 0.93, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. The strongest predictors of mortality were {ASA}-{PS} 4 and 5 (30 d) and cancer (1 and 2 yr). {CONCLUSION} {NZRISK}-{NEURO} is a robust multivariate calculator created specifically for neurosurgery, enabling physicians to generate data-driven individualized risk estimates, assisting shared decision-making and perioperative planning.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose Healthcare pathways define the execution sequence of clinical activities as patients move through a treatment process, and they are critical for maintaining quality of care. The aim of this study is to combine healthcare pathway discovery with predictive models of individualized recovery times. The pathway discovery has a particular emphasis on producing pathway models that are easy to interpret for clinicians without a sufficient background in process mining. The predictive model takes the stochastic volatility of pathway performance indicators into account. Method This study utilizes the business process-mining software {ProM} to design a process mining pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery and enrichment using hospital records. The efficacy of combining learned healthcare pathways with probabilistic machine learning models is demonstrated via a case study that applies the proposed process mining pipeline to discover appendicitis pathways from hospital records. Machine learning methodologies based on probabilistic programming are utilized to explore pathway features that influence patient recovery time. Results The produced appendicitis pathway models are easy for clinical interpretation and provide an unbiased overview of patient movements through the treatment process. Analysis of the discovered pathway model enables reasons for longer than usual treatment times to be explored and deviations from standard treatment pathways to be identified. A probabilistic regression model that estimates patient recovery time based on the information extracted by the process mining pipeline is developed and has the potential to be very useful for hospital scheduling purposes. Conclusion This study establishes the application of the business process modelling tool {ProM} for the improvement of healthcare pathway mining methods. The proposed pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery has the potential to support the development of probabilistic machine learning models to further relate healthcare pathways to performance indicators such as patient recovery time.},

By training a model to predict triage decisions from these referral documents, we can partially automate the triage process, resulting in more efficient and systematic triage decisions. One of the difficulties of this task is maintaining robustness against changes in triage priorities due to changes in policy, funding, staff, or other factors. This is reflected as changes in relationship between document features and triage labels, also known as concept drift. These changes must be detected so that the model can be retrained to reflect the new environment. We introduce a new concept drift detection algorithm for this domain called calibrated drift detection method ({CDDM}).

However, accuracy alone is not enough, explanation and understanding is equally important to clinicians, governments, and patients. Possibly leading to loss of health benefits potentially realized through increasingly accurate algorithms. However, various techniques exist for auditing machine learning systems via insightful visualisations. Modelling best practices, parallel computations and open source technologies facilitate implementation of these techniques. This paper leverages several of these methods to increase interpretability for a black-box clinical risk calculator, hopefully opening the door to a better adoption of modern machine learning pipelines in the healthcare sector.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms can play a significant role in peoples lives. The data used in these algorithms often contains sensitive information and can have inherent biases. We investigate the effects of the interaction between mechanisms designed to preserve privacy and to mitigate biases. The mechanisms employed for this investigation were k-anonymity for de-identification and re-weighting for bias mitigation. The experiments were threefold. First, we investigated the effects of mitigation on de-identified data. Second, we measured the effects of three data parameters: class imbalance ratio, privileged positive outcome ratio and unprivileged positive outcome ratio. Third, we assessed the utility of the mitigation mechanism in a healthcare context. Using real-world data, we tested the effects of different levels of de-identification. We primarily utilised three measures to indicate the procedures’ effects. First, for accuracy, we analysed simple accuracy and balanced accuracy rate. Second, we measured the number of positive outcomes for the privileged and unprivileged class and the disparate impact for fairness. Third, for utility, we measured the recall rate as well as a novel metric; recall ratio. We display these two metrics based on the classification threshold to indicate the trade-off between achieving high true positives while limiting overall positive outcomes. This trade-off is analogous to a medical testing scenario where the objective is to have high accuracy of true positives and minimise cost given overall percent positives.},

	abstract = {Fairness is an increasingly important concern as machine learning models are used to support decision making in high-stakes applications such as mortgage lending, hiring, and prison sentencing. This paper introduces a new open source Python toolkit for algorithmic fairness, {AI} Fairness 360 ({AIF}360), released under an Apache v2.0 license \{https://github.com/ibm/aif360). The main objectives of this toolkit are to help facilitate the transition of fairness research algorithms to use in an industrial setting and to provide a common framework for fairness researchers to share and evaluate algorithms. The package includes a comprehensive set of fairness metrics for datasets and models, explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models. It also includes an interactive Web experience (https://aif360.mybluemix.net) that provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities for line-of-business users, as well as extensive documentation, usage guidance, and industry-specific tutorials to enable data scientists and practitioners to incorporate the most appropriate tool for their problem into their work products. The architecture of the package has been engineered to conform to a standard paradigm used in data science, thereby further improving usability for practitioners. Such architectural design and abstractions enable researchers and developers to extend the toolkit with their new algorithms and improvements, and to use it for performance benchmarking. A built-in testing infrastructure maintains code quality.},

In recent years, the volume of data used within organisations has increased dramatically, playing a critical role in business operations. This paper explores the current literature on data governance and is intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of the activities involved in data governance. Six major academic databases in the {IS} domain were searched using key terms to identify and analyse material reflecting the current state of knowledge. A systematic procedure was developed to identify 31 papers that explicitly mention data governance activities. Open coding techniques were applied to conduct content analysis, resulting in 110 data governance activities across five decision domains of the data governance framework. These data governance activities are understood as: ‘action’ plus ‘area of governance’ plus ‘decision domain’ e.g. (define data policies for data quality). Our analysis shows a high volume of data governance activities associated with the ‘defining’ action of the areas of governance across the decision domains with a lack of reported on the ‘implementing’ and ‘monitoring’ actions.},

Fairlearn has two components: an interactive visualization dashboard and unfairness mitigation algorithms. These components are designed to help with navigating trade-offs between fairness and model performance. We emphasize that prioritizing fairness in {AI} systems is a sociotechnical challenge. Because there are many complex sources of unfairness—some societal and some technical—it is not possible to fully “debias” a system or to guarantee fairness; the goal is to mitigate fairness-related harms as much as possible. As Fairlearn grows to include additional fairness metrics, unfairness mitigation algorithms, and visualization capabilities, we hope that it will be shaped by a diverse community of stakeholders, ranging from data scientists, developers, and business decision makers to the people whose lives may be affected by the predictions of {AI} systems.},

As the importance of machine learning fairness has become increasingly apparent, recent research has focused on potentially surprising long term behaviors of enforcing measures of fairness that were originally defined in a static setting. Key findings have shown that under specific assumptions in simplified dynamic simulations, long term effects may in fact counteract the desired goals. Achieving a deeper understanding of such long term effects is thus a critical direction for {ML} fairness research. {ML}-fairness-gym implements a generalized framework for studying and probing long term fairness effects in carefully constructed simulation scenarios where a learning agent interacts with an environment over time. This work fits into a larger push in the fair machine learning literature to design decision systems that induce fair outcomes in the long run, and to understand how these systems might differ from those designed to enforce fairness on a one-shot basis.},

	abstract = {Predictive Risk Models which utilize routinely collected data to develop algorithms are used in England to stratify patients according to their hospital admission risk. An individual's risk score can be used as a basis to select patients for hospital avoidance programmes. This paper presents a brief empirical analysis of New Zealand hospital data to create a prediction algorithm and illustrates how a hospital avoidance business case can be developed using the model. A sample of 134,262 patients was analyzed in a Multivariate logistic regression, various socioeconomic factors and indictors of previous admissions were used to predict the probability that a patient is readmitted to hospital within the 12 months following discharge. The key factors for readmission prediction were age, sex, diagnosis of last admission, length of stay and cost-weight of previous admission. The prognostic strength of the algorithm was good, with a randomly selected patient with a future re-admission being 71.2\% more likely to receive a higher risk score than one who will not have a future admission.},

Since its beginning, the Framingham study has been a leader in identifying {CVD} risk factors. Clinical trials have demonstrated that when the modifiable risk factors are treated and corrected, the chances of {CVD} occurring can be reduced. The Framingham study also recognized that {CVD} risk factors are multifactorial and interact over time to produce {CVD}. In response, Framingham investigators developed the Framingham Risk Functions (also called Framingham Risk Scores) to evaluate the chance or likelihood of developing {CVD} in individuals. These functions are multivariate functions (algorithms) that combine the information in {CVD} risk factors such as sex, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking behavior, and diabetes status to produce an estimate (or risk) of developing {CVD} or a component of {CVD} (such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or heart failure) over a fixed time, for example, the next 10 years. These estimates of {CVD} risk are often major inputs in recommending drug treatments such as cholesterol-lowering drugs.},

	shorttitle = {Credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare},
	abstract = {The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model’s credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee’s multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.},

Transfer learning is currently the starting point for recognition tasks such as computer vision. However, in natural language processing ({NLP}), the application of this technique is less prevalent. Our research investigates how, through the application of transfer learning, existing knowledge can be used to build more accurate {NLP} models. We subsequently applied these models to a named-entity recognition ({NER}) task. Our experimental results show significantly better recognition performance can be obtained through leveraging knowledge from a base model, trained using poorly annotated data.},

This research was focused on the evaluation of {LACE} Index for Readmission - Length of stay (days), Acute (emergent) admission, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of {ED} visits within six months ({LACE}) and Patients At Risk of Hospital Readmission ({PARR}) using New Zealand hospital admissions. This research estimates the risk for all readmissions rather than only those in a subset of referenced conditions. In total, 213,440 admissions between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 Dec 2016 were selected after appropriate ethics approvals and permissions from the three hospitals. The evaluation method used is the Receiver Operating Characteristics ({ROC}) analysis to evaluate the accuracy of both the {LACE} and {PARR} models. As a result, The {LACE} index achieved an Area Under the Curve ({AUC}) score of 0.658 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the {LACE} index is a score of 7 or more with sensitivity of 0.752 and specificity of 0.564. Whereas, the {PARR} algorithm achieved an {AUC} score of 0.628 in predicting 30-day readmissions. The optimal cut-off for the {PARR} index is a score of 0.34 or more with sensitivity of 0.714 and specificity of 0.542.},

With advanced sensors, sophisticated hardware and fast-growing wireless communication technologies, there are enormous opportunities for ubiquitous solutions in all areas of healthcare, especially patient monitoring. Current methods of non-invasive blood pressure measurement are based on inflation and deflation of a cuff with some effects on arteries where blood pressure is being measured. This approach is non-continuous, time delayed, and might cause patient discomfort. We aim to monitor and measure cuff-less and continuous blood pressure using a smartphone. Cuff-less approach enables continuous blood pressure monitoring capabilities and is particularly attractive as blood pressure is one of the most important factors to assess risk of falls in older adults. A smartphone application was developed to collect {PhotoPlethysmoGram} ({PPG}) waveform and electrocardiogram ({ECG}) in order to calculate pulse transit time ({PTT}). The user\&apos;s systolic blood pressure is calculated using the {PPT} and precise optimisation model. The proposed application can be integrated with our developed falls risk assessment algorithm for inpatient older adults. This study proposes a novel approach of continuous blood pressure monitoring using cuff-less method that can be employed for prevention of inpatient falls using smartphone.},

We evaluated the outcomes following genotyping for {CYP}2C19 in a propensity matched {ACS} cohort treated with either clopidogrel or ticagrelor.Methods: {ICD}10 coding identified 4,995 {ACS} patients at Waitemata District Health Board over a five year period (2012-2016). Patients were genotyped for {CYP}2C19 *2, *3 and *17 alleles using either the Nanosphere Verigene analyzer or Sequenom Massarray, and treatment tailored accordingly. Logistic regression and nearest neighbor propensity matching was employed in a 1:3:3 (genotyped:ticagrelor:clopidogrel) fashion to balance patient characteristics.Results: A total of 146 patients were genotyped and compared with 438 matched patients taking either clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Of the genotyped patients, 93 (64\%) were treated with clopidogrel. Post July 2013 71\% responders versus 54\% without genotype information were prescribed clopidogrel (X2 7, 95\% {CI} 4 to 28, p{\textbackslash}textless0.009). Personalized treatment was noninferior to ticagrelor {HR} 0.9, 95\% {CI}: 0.4 to 2.1 and superior to clopidogrel {HR} 0.4, 95\% {CI}: 0.18 to 0.99, p=0.0002, with respect to all-cause mortality. Readmissions with {ACS} were higher in nonresponders treated with clopidogrel versus ticagrelor ({HR} 0.4, 95\% {CI} 0.13 to 0.98, p=0.03) but equivalent between responders treated with clopidogrel versus ticagrelor ({HR} 1.1, 95\% {CI} 0.5 to 2.9).Conclusion: Personalized antiplatelet management was noninferior to ticagrelor with respect to all-cause mortality and {ACS} readmissions. It also led to more appropriate use of both clopidogrel and ticagrelor with resultant cost savings.},

The key contributing factors to the proposed model include heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate, breathing volume, and activity data (steps, cadence and calories). The data was collected using an advanced wearable body vest. The real-time data was combined with manual recordings of blood glucose, height, weight, age and sex. The model analyzed the data alongside a clinical knowledge-base. Fuzzy rules were used to establish baseline values via existing interventions, clinical guidelines and protocols. The proposed model was tested and validated using Kappa analysis and achieved an overall agreement of 91\%.},

The system provides a mobile-app front end for the patients, a diagnostic unit, and a doctor's interface for accessing patient records. The diagnostic unit consists of three main modules: An analysis engine for under- standing patients symptom descriptions, a symptom-to-cause mapper for reasoning about potential causes, and a question generator for deriving further interview questions. The system combines data-driven natural language processing capability with knowledge-driven diagnostic capability. We evaluate our proof-of-concept on benchmark case studies and compare the system with existing medical chatbots.},

	issn = {1175-8716},
	abstract = {{AIM}: The aim of the present observational study was to provide a description of the demographic, psychological and pain characteristics of patients attending the Waitemata Pain Services ({WPS}), Auckland, New Zealand. {METHOD}: Data were collected via a comprehensive paper-pencil questionnaire handed out to 798 consecutive new patients seen at the {WPS} over a four-year period. {RESULTS}: 32.3\% attending the {WPS} were men and 67.7\% women, with a mean age of 52.1 years. 65.7\% of patients were New Zealand Europeans, followed by 19.1\% other Europeans, 5.7\% Asians, 3.9\% Māori, 2.8\% Middle Eastern/Latin/Africans and 2.7\% Pacific Islanders. Patients reported an average of 2.6 visits to the {GP} before presenting to the unit. Average pain duration was seven years and seven months. Women reported a significantly higher number of pain sites in the whole body, as well as in the left and right side of the body compared to men (p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001 for all). Highest interference due to pain was found for enjoyment of life. Men and women further differed in a range of psycho-behavioural variables, with women reporting less psychological distress and depression but more stress compared to men (p{\textbackslash}textless0.05 for all). Men showed higher levels of kinesiophobia (p{\textbackslash}textless0.005) and less pain acceptance and pain willingness (p{\textbackslash}textless0.05 for both). Cross-cultural comparison found Māori patients reported highest pain levels, highest number of pain sites, highest pain interference, as well as highest levels of psychological distress, depression, stress and anxiety compared to all other ethnicities. Lowest pain severity was reported for New Zealand European patients and lowest interference due to pain for Pacific Islanders. While Middle Eastern/Latin/African patients showed highest levels of kinesiophobia, Pacific Islanders had the highest tendencies to catastrophise about their pain. {CONCLUSION}: There are important sex- and ethnicity-related differences in the clinical presentation of chronic pain patients attending a large, hospital-based New Zealand pain service. While service provision can be based on generalised guidelines, specific interventions should be informed by important demographic and cultural variables. Studies are needed to identify strategies to improve service delivery in subgroups of the population who may be undertreated or lack access to appropriate interventions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Many multivariable models to calculate mortality risk after surgery are limited by insufficient sample size at development or by application to cohorts distinct from derivation populations. The aims of this study were to validate the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool ({SORT}) for a New Zealand population and to develop an extended {NZRISK} model to calculate 1-month, 1-year and 2-year mortality after non-cardiac surgery. Methods Data from the New Zealand National Minimum Data Set for patients having surgery between January 2013 and December 2014 were used to validate {SORT}. A random 75 per cent split of the data was used to develop the {NZRISK} model, which was validated in the other 25 per cent of the data set. Results External validation of {SORT} in the 360 140 patients who underwent surgery in the study period showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUROC}) value of 0·906) but poor calibration ({McFadden}'s pseudo-R2 0·137, calibration slope 5·32), indicating it was invalid in this national surgical population. Internal validation of the {NZRISK} model, which incorporates sex and ethnicity in addition to the variables used in {SORT} for 1-month, 1-year and 2-year outcomes, demonstrated excellent discrimination with {AUROC} values of 0·921, 0·904 and 0·895 respectively, and excellent calibration ({McFadden}'s pseudo-R2 0·275, 0·308 and 0·312 respectively). Calibration slopes were 1·12, 1·02 and 1·02 respectively. Conclusion The {SORT} performed poorly in this national population. However, inclusion of sex and ethnicity in the {NZRISK} model improved performance. Calculation of mortality risk beyond 30 days after surgery adds to the utility of this tool for shared decision-making.},

	abstract = {Background Telehealth is often suggested to improve access to health care and has had significant publicity worldwide during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. However, limited studies have examined the telehealth needs of underserved populations such as rural communities. Objective This study aims to investigate enablers for telehealth use in underserved rural populations to improve access to health care for rural older adults. Methods In total, 7 focus group discussions and 13 individual interviews were held across 4 diverse underserved rural communities. A total of 98 adults aged ≥55 years participated. The participants were asked whether they had used telehealth, how they saw their community’s health service needs evolving, how telehealth might help provide these services, and how they perceived barriers to and enablers of telehealth for older adults in rural communities. Focus group transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results The term telehealth was not initially understood by many participants and required an explanation. Those who had used telehealth reported positive experiences (time and cost savings) and were likely to use telehealth again. A total of 2 main themes were identified through an equity lens. The first theme was trust, with 3 subthemes—trust in the telehealth technology, trust in the user (consumer and health provider), and trust in the health system. Having access to reliable and affordable internet connectivity and digital devices was a key enabler for telehealth use. Most rural areas had intermittent and unreliable internet connectivity. Another key enabler is easy access to user support. Trust in the health system focused on waiting times, lack of and/or delayed communication and coordination, and cost. The second theme was choice, with 3 subthemes—health service access, consultation type, and telehealth deployment. Access to health services through telehealth needs to be culturally appropriate and enable access to currently limited or absent services such as mental health and specialist services. Accessing specialist care through telehealth was extremely popular, although some participants preferred to be seen in person. A major enabler for telehealth was telehealth deployment by a fixed community hub or on a mobile bus, with support available, particularly when combined with non–health-related services such as internet banking. Conclusions Overall, participants were keen on the idea of telehealth. Several barriers and enablers were identified, particularly trust and choice. The term telehealth is not well understood. The unreliable and expensive connectivity options available to rural communities have limited telehealth experience to phone or patient portal use for those with connectivity. Having the opportunity to try telehealth, particularly by using video, would increase the understanding and acceptance of telehealth. This study highlights that local rural communities need to be involved in designing telehealth services within their communities.},

	title = {Balancing Utility and Fairness Against Privacy for Sensitive Data},
	abstract = {Machine learning models continue to replace human decision making in high-stakes environments. In elds as diverse as healthcare, college acceptance and loan approval these algorithms can have signi cant e ects on peoples lives. Privacy has long been a concern when dealing with sensitive information. Recently, fairness in machine learning has become a signi cant concern as well. Previous research has established a well known tradeo between privacy and accuracy. More recently, research has investigated the trade-o between fairness and accuracy. The focus of this thesis is the interaction between these two concepts. This is a recent eld of study and most research focuses on the interaction of an individual de-identi cation mechanism and the subsequent bias mitigation methods which follow a similar methodology. In this thesis we investigate the complex interaction between privacy, fairness, and accuracy through multiple de-identi cation and bias mitigation mechanisms. As motivating examples we address the general privacy cases as well as the healthcare eld. We consider a scenario where a company that has access to sensitive records, be they medical or nancial, would like to publish this data for users to analyse. The company operates under a regulatory environment which requires them to de-identify the data to protect the privacy of the individuals in the data. Additionally, the company would like to ensure that the data is not biased towards any particular groups. We rst developed a technique to assess the level of fairness loss and accuracy loss due to the de-identi cation process. We developed two novel measures to assess this loss. We applied this to multiple levels of de-identi ed data to assess the impact that de-identi cation has on these measures. Following this we adapted this technique to assess the fairness gain and the accuracy loss due to bias mitigation on the original and de-identi ed data. We adapted our novel measures to apply them to this comparison. Finally, we adapted a bandit based hyper-parameter optimisation mechanism to assess the hyper-parameters of the mitigation mechanisms and hyper-parameters to achieve a good trade-o between fairness and accuracy on de-identi ed data.},

	abstract = {Efficient elective surgery scheduling is one of the pain points in the current healthcare management and has a serious impact on the overall healthcare delivery. Currently, the health organizations struggle to achieve their elective surgeries/outpatient targets due to clinical and non-clinical reasons. Some of the common factors are day of surgery cancellations, use of medications, and development of unforeseen clinical complexities. Nonclinical factors could be surgeon’s schedule and unavailability of the operating rooms or equipment. Overcoming these issues will enable the hospital to increase their efficiency and ultimately serve more patients within the allocated budgets with reduced wait-times for the surgery. This research presents an in-depth literature review of the elective surgery models, elective health strategies in practice and key enablers for change with regards to the elective procedures. Furthermore, we present a concept of using agent-based model ({ABM}) to simulate system dynamics of an elective surgery scheduling process. The model is validated by experimentations and altering parameters of the built model. As an outcome, the proposed model is capable of handling hospital resource utilization, time estimation of each case (surgery) from the waiting list and forecasting the scheduling of the surgeons.},

	abstract = {The study presents a blockchain-based incentive mechanism intended to encourage those in underserved communities to engage with healthcare services. The smart healthcare system, which is the result of the amalgamation of advanced technologies, has emerged recently and is increasingly seen as essential to meet the needs of modern society. An important part of the healthcare system is the prescription management system, but studies show that prescription affordability and accessibility play a part in creating unequal access for underserved communities. This is a form of unequal access that results in those living in underserved communities to become disengaged from accessing healthcare services. In New Zealand, the prescription management system plays a crucial role and this study seeks to address the issue by presenting the {BlockPres} framework, which uses a novel incentive mechanism to encourage patients to participate and engage with services in order to be rewarded. The blockchain attribute of immutability in {BlockPres} enhances equality and participation by providing sophisticated authorisation and authentication capabilities for healthcare providers and patients. {BlockPres} empowers the patient by assigning ownership or control of some patient information to the patient. A simulation is carried out using the Ethereum blockchain and the evaluation of successful transaction completion and superficial performance assessment demonstrates that the blockchain would be sufficient to cope with the needs of a prescription management system. Furthermore, for the simulation, a {BlockPres} Smart Contract is developed using solidity and implemented in Remix. The Ropsten network is used as the simulation environment and the initial results show that the proposed incentive mechanism mitigates unequal access.},

	abstract = {Supporting clinicians in decision making using advanced technologies has been an active research area in biomedical engineering during the past years. Among a wide range of ubiquitous systems, smartphone applications have been increasingly developed in healthcare settings to help clinicians as well as patients. Today, many smartphone applications, from basic data analysis to advanced patient monitoring, are available to clinicians and patients. Such applications are now increasingly integrating into healthcare for clinical decision support, and therefore, concerns around accuracy, stability, and dependency of these applications are rising. In addition, lack of attention to the clinicians’ acceptability, as well as the low impact on the medical professionals’ decision making, are posing more serious issues on the acceptability of smartphone applications. This article reviews smartphone-based decision support applications, focusing on hospital care settings and their overall impact of these applications on the wider clinical workflow. Additionally, key challenges and barriers of the current ubiquitous device-based healthcare applications are identified.

Hira is intended to provide patients with better access to and control over their health information.5 Several countries, such as Sweden and Estonia have a longer history of providing patient accessible electronic health records ({PAEHRs}) than New Zealand.6 {PAEHRs} are purported to benefit patients, health services and the wider health system.7 The benefits of patient access have included the opportunity to empower patients, inform patients about their health, increase patient health literacy, and involve patients in their own care.8'9 Furthermore, a key benefit is quick and easy access to health information whenever it is needed, including when accessing care with a different provider/service. Making available and supporting a portal for consumers to access their hospital data is mired in governance challenges, such as who can take what action, upon what data, in what situations, and using what methods.

	abstract = {Internationally, studies have shown widespread public support for secondary uses of health information as long as it is for "the greater good" or public benefit.13 Trustworthiness, privacy and data security are key themes in public surveys, and individual consent is acknowledged as not always being necessary.1·4 Concerns have centred on misuse of data and the potential for harm as a result, alongside potential commercial gain.45 In general, there is a call for more transparency69 accountability to protect against data misuse67 and public engagement and communication with consumers.1·410 In Aotearoa New Zealand, many of these issues are considered in the National Ethical Standards for Health and Disability Research and Quality Improvement,11 including Maori data sovereignty.12 Moving towards more insights from accessible health and social data to support not just health service delivery, but also policy development, research and service planning, is included in the Ministry of Health's Digital Health Strategic Framework13 and Hira, the national health information platform.14 Over the past six years Waitematà District Health Board ({DHB}) has been incrementally introducing new electronic health information systems across its two hospitals (Waitakere and North Shore). The Leapfrog Programme has intentionally been moving towards a more digital and mobile system that supports good clinical workflow and ensures that necessary information is available at the point of care to support good patient outcomes and experience.15 One of the outcomes of these developments has been the large increase in the amount of electronic health information available for uses such as service review and quality improvement, future service planning and potentially for research. What is not clear is how New Zealanders feel about the use of their health information beyond their immediate healthcare, or whether people are aware that service and population-level activities may be using their health information to inform improvements in health services and future service planning. More recent work exploring perspectives on the use of individual data in New Zealand has mainly focused on the general public's views outside the health service setting.17-19 Globally, machine-learning techniques and artifcial-intelligence-derived algorithms are being developed based on large electronic health datasets that can predict health outcomes after treatment or proce-dures,20-21 support clinical decision-making (eg, identify early signs of sepsis)22-24 and identify abnormalities in images (eg, retinal screening).25-28 There is growing interest to use patient health information for these purposes in New Zealand.29-31 To determine whether such methods could be useful in New Zealand clinical practice, they must be tested on large electronic databases of New Zealanders' health information.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION} Inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is a chronic, relapsing disease re- quiring ongoing monitoring. Smartphone applications will allow re- mote monitoring of a large geographical catchment of Waitematā Dis- trict Health Board ({WDHB}). {IBDSmart} (Otago University/Gut Health Network) is a phone application for patients to self-report flares and monitor disease using validated scoring systems. {IBDSmart} has been shown to be non-inferior to standard care and to reduce face-to-face appointments. {IBD}-Disk® provides validated visual representation of Quality of Life ({QoL}), allowing for patient-centred discussions in clinic and tracking {QoL} with treatment. The aim of this study was to un- derstand if these applications are feasible in the outpatient setting in terms of patient/clinician feedback and validity of patient’s scores. {METHODS} {IBD} patients attending {WDHB} gastroenterology clinics were re- cruited over the phone, emailed brochures, and asked to complete {IBDSmart}/{IBD}-Disk® surveys one to two weeks before their appoint- ments. Clinicians were provided with Harvey Bradshaw Index ({HBI})/ Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index ({SCCAI}) at appointment and reminded to discuss {IBD}-Disk® responses. Feedback was collected using five-point scoring of five affirmative statements. {RESULTS} Eighty-four participants were contacted; 45 used {IBDSmart} and 10 used {IBD}-Disk®. Nine clinicians were involved. There were techni- cal issues; {IBDSmart} links expired within 48hours, and {IBD}-Disk® does not work in Android Operating Systems 9.0–11.0. The majori- ty (≥60\%) of participants and clinicians either completely agreed or agreed with statements. Correlation between clinician and patient scores was moderate (R2 for {HBI} 0.52, for {SCCAI} 0.49). {CONCLUSIONS} Both applications are highly useable and accepted by patients and cli- nicians. However, technological issues need to be addressed. Correla- tion of scores could be improved through increased patient education and application design.},

	abstract = {The benefits of explainable artificial intelligence are not what they appear Artificial intelligence and machine learning ({AI}/{ML}) algorithms are increasingly developed in health care for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of medical conditions (1). However, despite the technical prowess of such systems, their adoption has been challenging, and whether and how much they will actually improve health care remains to be seen. A central reason for this is that the effectiveness of {AI}/{ML}-based medical devices depends largely on the behavioral characteristics of its users, who, for example, are often vulnerable to well-documented biases or algorithmic aversion (2). Many stakeholders increasingly identify the so-called black-box nature of predictive algorithms as the core source of users' skepticism, lack of trust, and slow uptake (3, 4). As a result, lawmakers have been moving in the direction of requiring the availability of explanations for black-box algorithmic decisions (5). Indeed, a near-consensus is emerging in favor of explainable {AI}/{ML} among academics, governments, and civil society groups. Many are drawn to this approach to harness the accuracy benefits of noninterpretable {AI}/{ML} such as deep learning or neural nets while also supporting transparency, trust, and adoption. We argue that this consensus, at least as applied to health care, both overstates the benefits and undercounts the drawbacks of requiring black-box algorithms to be explainable.},
